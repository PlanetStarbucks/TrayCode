# TrayCode

This script is to create a static map of metaproperty values for assets uploaded in a Bynder solution. Using a Bynder auth slot, it will call the Bynder metaproperties for that account, and return them in an array.

This is part 1 of creating a mapping tool. With this array, it can be fed into another config slot that uses Tray.io mapping. The fields can be displayed in the mapping table by selecting it from the input field of the tool.
